apt and yum are both package managers used to install, update, and remove software on Linux systems, 
but they are used in different distributions of Linux:

apt (Advanced Package Tool):
Used in Debian-based distributions, including:
Debian
Ubuntu and its derivatives (like Linux Mint, Elementary OS, Pop!_OS, etc.)
Kali Linux
Raspbian (on Raspberry Pi devices)
apt is used to manage .deb (Debian package) files.
Common commands:
apt update (to update the package list)
apt upgrade (to upgrade installed packages)
apt install <package_name> (to install a package)
apt remove <package_name> (to remove a package)

yum (Yellowdog Updater Modified):
Used in Red Hat-based distributions, including:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
CentOS (before it was replaced by CentOS Stream)
Fedora (though Fedora uses dnf now as the default package manager, yum is still supported)
Scientific Linux (a derivative of RHEL)
Oracle Linux
AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux (as RHEL-compatible alternatives after CentOS Stream's shift)
yum manages .rpm (RPM package) files.
Common commands:
yum update (to update packages)
yum install <package_name> (to install a package)
yum remove <package_name> (to remove a package)
yum list installed (to list installed packages)
